    # Code Review - Recent Changes

    Review all changes since the last commit.

    ## Step 1: Examine Changes

    Run `git diff HEAD~1` to see what changed (or `git diff --staged` for uncommitted changes).

    ## Step 2: Apply Review Perspectives

    - **Architecture** - Structure, boundaries, testability, technical debt
    - **Performance** - Algorithms, data structures, complexity, efficiency
    - **Standards** - Readability, naming, documentation, canonical patterns
    - **Concurrency** - Thread safety, race conditions, synchronization (if applicable)
    - **Domain** - Business logic correctness, domain model accuracy (if applicable)

    ## Step 3: Report Findings

    ### Summary
    What do these changes accomplish?

    ### Critical Issues
    Must fix before merging.

    ### Medium Issues
    Should address but doesn't block.

    ### Minor Issues
    Style and small improvements.

    ### Positive Observations
    Good patterns worth noting.

    ## Steps

    1. **Examine**: `git diff HEAD~1` (or `git diff --staged` for uncommitted)

    2. **Review Perspectives**:
       - Architecture: structure, boundaries, testability, tech debt
       - Performance: algorithms, data structures, complexity
       - Standards: readability, naming, docs, patterns
       - Concurrency: thread safety, races, sync (if applicable)
       - Domain: business logic, domain model (if applicable)

    3. **Report**:
       - Summary: what changes accomplish
       - Critical: must fix before merge
       - Medium: should address, non-blocking
       - Minor: style/small improvements
       - Positives: good patterns worth noting
