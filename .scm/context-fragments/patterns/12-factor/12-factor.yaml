    # Twelve-Factor App

    Methodology for building modern, cloud-native SaaS applications that are portable, scalable, and maintainable.

    ## I. Codebase
    One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys. Each app has exactly one repo. Multiple apps sharing code is a violation—extract shared code into libraries included via dependency manager. Multiple deploys (dev, staging, prod) share the same codebase but may run different versions.

    ## II. Dependencies
    Explicitly declare and isolate all dependencies. Never rely on implicit existence of system-wide packages. Use a dependency declaration manifest (go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile) and a dependency isolation tool (Go modules, npm, virtualenv, bundler) to ensure no dependencies leak in from the surrounding system.

    ## III. Config
    Store configuration in environment variables. Config is everything that varies between deploys (credentials, resource handles, hostnames). Strict separation of config from code—config changes without code changes. Never commit credentials, API keys, or secrets to the codebase. Environment variables are language/OS-agnostic and granular.

    ## IV. Backing Services
    Treat backing services as attached resources. A backing service is any service the app consumes over the network: databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka), caches (Redis, Memcached), SMTP services, APIs. Make no distinction between local and third-party services. Swap a local MySQL for Amazon RDS by changing config, no code changes required.

    ## V. Build, Release, Run
    Strictly separate build, release, and run stages:
    - **Build**: Convert code repo into executable bundle (compile, fetch dependencies, build assets)
    - **Release**: Combine build with deploy's config. Every release has a unique ID (timestamp or version)
    - **Run**: Execute release in the execution environment (launch processes)

    Releases are immutable. Any change creates a new release. Rollback by deploying a previous release.

    ## VI. Processes
    Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. Processes are stateless and share-nothing. Any data that needs to persist must be stored in a stateful backing service (database, cache). Never assume anything cached in memory or on disk will be available on a future request. Sticky sessions violate twelve-factor—store session state in a datastore with time-expiration (Redis, Memcached).

    ## VII. Port Binding
    Export services via port binding. The app is completely self-contained and does not rely on runtime injection of a webserver. The web app exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port and listening for requests. In development, the developer visits a URL like http://localhost:5000/. In production, a routing layer handles routing from a public hostname to the port-bound process.

    ## VIII. Concurrency
    Scale out via the process model. Processes are a first-class citizen. The app can scale horizontally by running more processes. Different process types handle different workloads (web processes handle HTTP requests, worker processes handle background jobs). Never daemonize or write PID files—rely on the operating system's process manager (systemd, Kubernetes, Heroku dyno manager).

    ## IX. Disposability
    Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown. Processes are disposable—they can be started or stopped at a moment's notice. Minimize startup time to facilitate rapid scaling and deployment. Shut down gracefully on SIGTERM: stop accepting new requests, finish current requests, then exit. For workers, return current job to the queue. Design for sudden death—use robust queueing backends.

    ## X. Dev/Prod Parity
    Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible. Minimize gaps:
    - **Time gap**: Deploy code hours after writing, not weeks
    - **Personnel gap**: Developers who write code are closely involved in deploying and observing it
    - **Tools gap**: Keep dev and prod as similar as possible (same databases, queues, caches)

    Resist the urge to use different backing services between environments (SQLite in dev, PostgreSQL in prod). Lightweight local services like Docker make this achievable.

    ## XI. Logs
    Treat logs as event streams. A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream. Write all logs unbuffered to stdout. In development, the developer views the stream in their terminal. In staging/production, the execution environment captures and routes streams to log aggregators (Splunk, Datadog, ELK stack) or archives. The app is unaware of and decoupled from log management.

    ## XII. Admin Processes
    Run admin and management tasks as one-off processes. One-off admin processes (database migrations, console/REPL, one-time scripts) should run in an identical environment to the app's regular long-running processes. Run against a release using the same codebase and config. Admin code ships with application code to avoid synchronization issues.

    Here's the compressed version:

    # 12-Factor App

    Cloud-native SaaS methodology for portable, scalable apps.

    ## I. Codebase
    1 repo per app, many deploys. Shared code → libraries via deps.

    ## II. Dependencies
    Explicitly declare/isolate all deps. Never rely on system packages. Use manifest (go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt) + isolation tool.

    ## III. Config
    Store in env vars. Config = deploy-varying data (creds, hosts). Never commit secrets. Strict separation from code.

    ## IV. Backing Services
    Treat as attached resources (DBs, queues, caches, APIs). No distinction local vs third-party. Swap via config, not code.

    ## V. Build, Release, Run
    Strictly separate:
    - **Build**: Code → executable (compile, deps, assets)
    - **Release**: Build + config. Unique ID, immutable
    - **Run**: Execute in environment

    Rollback = deploy previous release.

    ## VI. Processes
    Stateless, share-nothing. Persist data in backing services. No sticky sessions—use Redis/Memcached for session state.

    ## VII. Port Binding
    Self-contained, export HTTP via port. No runtime webserver injection. Routing layer maps hostname → port.

    ## VIII. Concurrency
    Scale horizontally via process model. Different types (web, worker) for different workloads. Use OS process manager, not PID files.

    ## IX. Disposability
    Fast startup, graceful shutdown. On SIGTERM: stop accepting, finish current, exit. Workers return jobs to queue. Design for sudden death.

    ## X. Dev/Prod Parity
    Minimize gaps: time (hours not weeks), personnel (devs deploy), tools (same DBs/queues). Use Docker for local parity.

    ## XI. Logs
    Event streams to stdout. App decoupled from log routing/storage. Environment handles capture → aggregators.

    ## XII. Admin Processes
    Run one-off tasks (migrations, REPL) in identical environment. Same codebase/config as app. Ship admin code with app.
